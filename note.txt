Using Artificial Intelligent for enhancing human creativity
Mayssa A.A.Elfar and Mina E.T.Dawood,2023
Artificial Intelligence(AI)refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing
tasks that usually require human intelligence.The techniques used in AI include machine
learning,deep learning,natural language processing,speech recognition,and computer vision
(Hong and Curran,2019).These technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are
showing great promise for use in a variety of fields,including Art and Design.AI can recreate
existing artwork or produce completely new compositions from scratch,and it can also be used
to generate abstract images that are the result of random algorithms instead of humans'artistic
vision (Mikalonyte and Kneer,2021).
Several studies in recent years have attempted to evaluate the potential of AI applications in art
and design.The results of the research show that computers can be trained to create realistic-
looking paintings using simple shapes like circles and triangles.They can also create unique
works of art by combining different elements such as paint strokes and textures (Bur et al.,
2019).In the future,artificial intelligence could be used to help artists and designers to improve
their creations by providing them with feedback on their work-in-progress.Research into the use
of AI in art is still in its early stages,so it is too early to say what the long-term impact of these
technologies will be on the creative arts.However,it is becoming increasingly common to see
images and videos created by computer algorithms that are mistaken for works created by human
artists.As this technology becomes more sophisticated and more powerful,it seems likely that it
will become widely used in the creative arts in the future(Bello et al.,2015).
The many applications of artificial intelligence in the art and design world include the automated
creation of 3D objects (Nada and Dawood,2022),automatic image editing,modeling of bone
structure and the use of machine learning to automatically detect design mistakes.All of these
are examples of the increasing use of AI to improve the quality and efficiency of the work that is
done in this field.The use of AI to create creative images and innovative designs is becoming
increasingly common these days as computer algorithms are used to assist artists with the design
process.As depicted in Fig.1 below
Artificial intelligence (Al)applications have the potential to transform many aspects of art
creation and art appreciation.For example,AI can be used to automatically generate new works
of art or to create digital artworks that can be manipulated using computer-generated graphics
software (Chen and Chen,2020).Similarly,AI can also be used to automatically analyze a work
of art and identify various features such as color,texture,and composition.This can help reveal
new insights into the work of famous artists and help art historians develop new theories about
the evolution of artistic styles and techniques.It can also be used to help identify previously
unknown artwork that may exist in private or private collections around the world.In general,
many of the most exciting innovations in art and art history are likely to come from the use of Al
and other emerging technologies (Lim,2020).As artists and historians embrace these new
technologies,we may begin to see new and exciting ways in which these technologies can be
used to explore creativity and innovation in the history of art.However,it is difficult to predict
exactly how this new technology will be used by artists in the future.It is also important to
remember that while the widespread adoption of this technology may have significant impacts on
the future of art,we may also discover unintended effects as well (Agrawal et al.,2018).
The first program in artificial intelligence that could learn from experience was called ELIZA
and it was written in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
ELIZA was one of the first interactive computer programs able to speak like a human being.The
program was able to mimic human behavior by reading a set of questions and responding to
them.Another pioneer in the field of AI is Tim Berners-Lee who invented the World Wide Web
in 1989 and is considered to be the father of the Internet.He has been awarded many honorary
degrees for his work.It is believed by many scientists that the creation of the Web had a major
impact on the development of AI because it opened a new avenue of knowledge acquisition for
the field.In 1997 Dr.Gary Marcus at NYU developed another program called SHRDLU which
was able to respond to questions on its own and learn new words from experience.We will have
a profound effect on the future of humanity(Flasinski,2016).
With machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically generate new compositions from
existing images by selecting certain parts of the image and incorporating them into a new image.
Artists can also use these programs to help them analyze their work and improve it based on the
resulting data.There are many different scenarios for using AI in art or design.It can be used to
automatically create images that are like the images that the artist is trying to create but with
different elements added to give them more character.It can also be used to create new images
based on the artist's instructions but with different objects that the designer has in mind.

Arguments for the Rise of Artificial Intelligence Art:Does AI Art Have
Creativity,Motivation,Self-awareness and Emotion?
Bai Liu,2023
At present,the most questionable aspect of AI art-making is that of self-awareness and emotion:
Can AI be self-aware?Can AI have a soul?Can AI have emotions?Can AI feel pleasure or pain?
Can AI have empathy or jealousy?Does AI need to have 'life experience'to create art?Can AI
have empathy or jealousy,and does AI need 'life experience'to create art?These questions are
still highly controversial.If AI had self-awareness and emotions,what would be the impact on
humans?Will they turn the world upside down?
In order to address these controversial issues,the focus should first be on clarifying whether AI
has the potential to be self-aware and emotional.As already mentioned,'dataism'believes that
research on 'affective computing'is the key to advancing the humanization of AI.Of course,
some also argue that machines do not need 'consciousness'at all.The title of Marvin Minsky's
book The Emotion Machine:Commonsense Thinking,Artificial Intelligence,and the Future of
the Human Mind is a clear indication of this primary intention.In fact,in his book Society of
Mind (1985),Marvin Minsky suggested that "the question is not whether an intelligent machine
can have emotions,but whether an emotionless machine can be intelligent".This has given many
people an alternative perspective on the issue and suggests a relationship between emotion and
intelligence
In The Emotion Machine:Commonsense Thinking,Artificial Intelligence,and the Future of the
Human Mind,Marvin Minsky states the goal of the book:to explain how the human brain works,
to design machines that can understand and think,then to try to apply this thinking to
understanding ourselves and to developing AI.In addition,emotion is the way of thinking that
people use to enhance their intelligence (Minsky,2007,p.5-6).In this book,the author also
believes that the brain enhances its primitive response mechanisms through 'Critical-Selector
Machines'(Minsky,2007,p.27).If you can determine the problem you are facing,you will
choose a more appropriate way of thinking.At the same time,he divides mental activity into at
least 6 levels:instinctive reaction,acquired reaction,ruminating,reflection,self-reflection,and
self-conscious emotion (Minsky,2007,p.31-32).Significantly,the author also proposes 6
dimensions for creating an emotional machine:consciousness,a hierarchy of mental activity,
common sense,thinking,intelligence,and ego.These alone take up 6 chapters of the book.Of
course,the author acknowledges that it is not easy to study the consciousness and emotions of
AI,and a chapter is devoted to the 'emotion description puzzle'.
One of the more important points here is that intelligence is closely linked to emotion,and
without emotion,there can be no intelligence.Early research often assumed that robots would
not have consciousness and emotion.Some have compared the vital difference between robot
performers and human performers:although robots can perform technical tasks,they lack all the
elements of consciousness,intelligence,and emotion that contribute to developing interpretive
skills (Nagl,2022).However,the role of consciousness,intelligence,and emotion in interpreting
skills is also implicit.
It is important to re-emphasise that research into the working mechanisms of the brain is a
crucial issue in achieving AI awareness and emotion,where reverse engineering of the brain is in
full swing and various methods of achieving emotion are being actively explored.The most
complex part of the human brain is the EQ-Emotional Quotient and perceptual awareness,which
AI sees as the most sophisticated technology to develop.When the brain is successfully reverse-
engineered,it will be possible to use certain regions to simulate specific neurons to solve these
problems,so brilliant emotional robots can become commonplace (Marinaro,2020).Can we
arbitrarily say that machines must not have emotions?
There are already practical implementations of machine-driven emotions.One approach is to use
the Vor der Pol equation to create a simple non-linear dynamic model of basic emotions and to
analyse how the model can represent human emotions in the presence or absence of external
stimuli,thus simulating the change in emotion (Gong,Lin An,2019).In the case of musical
emotion,for example,the PAD three-dimensional emotion model can be used,which divides
emotion into three dimensions:pleasure,activation,and dominance.After extracting the musical
features (note density,beat,number of variations,maximum interval,tempo,proportion of chord
bars,etc.)and determining the emotion label,an emotion recognition system can be constructed.
This type of system can be based on a large number of emotion labelled music samples,and a
deep learning strategy to find the regularity of the emotion recognition and establish a cognitive
discriminant formula;the unknown emotion vector
can then be determined automatically


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a topic of intense debate in recent years, particularly in the realm of creativity and art. Some argue that AI can enhance human creativity by providing new ideas and expanding artistic horizons, while others contend that AI-generated art lacks the emotional depth and originality of human-made works (Elfara and Dawood, 2023; Liu, 2023). This essay will discuss both views and provide an opinion on the matter.

AI refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision (Elfara and Dawood, 2023). These technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are showing great promise for use in a variety of fields, including Art and Design. AI can recreate existing artwork or produce completely new compositions from scratch, and it can also be used to generate abstract images that are the result of random algorithms instead of humans' artistic vision (Elfara and Dawood, 2023).

They can also create unique works of art by combining different elements such as paint strokes and textures (Elfara and Dawood, 2023). In the future, AI could be used to help artists and designers improve their creations by providing them with feedback on their work-in-progress. However, it is too early to say what the long-term impact of these technologies will be on the creative arts (Elfara and Dawood, 2023).

On the other hand, the most questionable aspect of AI art-making is that of self-awareness and emotion. Questions such as "Can AI be self-aware?", "Can AI have a soul?", "Can AI have emotions?", "Can AI feel pleasure or pain?", "Can AI have empathy or jealousy?", and "Does AI need to have 'life experience' to create art?" are still highly controversial (Liu, 2023). If AI had self-awareness and emotions, what would be the impact on humans? Will they turn the world upside down?

Marvin Minsky, in his book The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind, states that the goal of the book is to explain how the human brain works, to design machines that can understand and think, then to try to apply this thinking to understanding ourselves and to developing AI. He also believes that the brain enhances its primitive response mechanisms through 'Critical-Selector Machines' (Minsky, 2007). This suggests a relationship between emotion and intelligence, and without emotion, there can be no intelligence.

In conclusion, while AI has shown great promise in the field of art and design, it is still a topic of intense debate. The potential for AI to enhance human creativity is vast, but the question of whether AI can truly possess self-awareness and emotion remains unanswered. As AI continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, it will be interesting to see how it impacts the world of art and creativity.
